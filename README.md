# Annotation
This repository contains a project dedicated to the recognition (classification) and positioning (in the future) of objects using Wi-Fi signals. For this i use CSI.

# CSI
When transmitting a Wi-Fi signal, the receiver can receive **Channel State Information** (CSI), which contains complex numbers describing the amplitude and phase of the signal subcarriers.

## Data-files
I get CSI from special data-files recorded by the receiving router (RX).
